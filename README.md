# Scheduler App

This scheduler project will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this app is to schedule employees appropriately and make sure they don't go over hours.

This app will have a database where it will hold the names of all the employees, their availability, and how many hours they currently have for the week. We will also need their email/number so that they get notified of schedule changes or if something comes up.

The schedule will have to go through the admins before being sent out to employees. Employees can appeal the schedule if something last minute comes up.

### Personal Motivation

The place I currently work at has a weak scheduling system. The main problems that has been consistent are shifts being unstaffed, no one replacing the shifts being dropped, and being scheduled on days that are not part of availability. These are the problems I want to solve. I have to keep in mind to keep an easy user experience for users who are not tech experienced.
